# Huffman Encoding - Challenge Problem 8a

Written for my analysis of algorithms class at CSUCI, Spring 2021.

## How to use:

Place the text that you would like to encode using huffmans algorithm and place it inside the file `input.txt`. 

Then you can use, `encodeFile.py` to write the huffman encoding dictionary, and the encoded text to `ouput.txt`.

Make sure to run `encodeFile.py` with the name of the input file as a command line argument.


To take that encoded text within `output.txt` run `decodeFile.py`. The decoded text will be placed inside `decoded.txt`.

If everything has gone as it should then `deocded.txt` will be identical to the input file.
